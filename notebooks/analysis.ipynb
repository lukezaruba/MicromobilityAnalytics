    "*Micromobility has been a recent interest of transportation planners and urban residents alike. One of the most popular implementations of micromobility in Minneapolis has been through motorized scooters from companies like Lime (Uber), Bird, or Lyft. There are comprehensive datasets available containing trip information for all scooter trips within the City, but using the data for understanding travel patterns and user behaviors has largely remained untouched. The data could have immense value to planners, residents, and other stakeholders, to inform future decision-making and more adequately prepare for how the urban landscape will change to accommodate greater volumes of scooters and other forms of micromobility. My solution is to use the powerful techniques of spatial data science to uncover these patterns and estimate when and where users are traveling **to** and **from**.*\n",
